## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a **complete landing page** built from **scratch**, as part of my learning process.

The main focus was on creating a clear and **structured** page layout using **Flexbox** to handle **section structure**, **alignment**, and **spacing**, while practicing **clean CSS organization** and **visual clarity.**

The layout was built without using any **frameworks, templates, or AI text editors.**

## 📝 Notes & Improvements
